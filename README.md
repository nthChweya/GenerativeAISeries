Everything Python: OOP+ with Native AI & Infinite Scale
Start with familiar Python syntax, then unlock AI capabilities, scale native programming and object spatial programming. Use Jac as a library in Python or write full Jac programs.

Jac introduces programming abstractions designed for AI, making it easy to integrate LLMs and multimodal models directly into your code with minimal effort.
