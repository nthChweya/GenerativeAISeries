# Jac for Agentic Programming

Jac is a drop-in replacement for Python and supersets Python, much like Typescript supersets Javascript or C++ supersets C. It extends Python's semantics while maintaining full interoperability with the Python ecosystem, introducing cutting-edge abstractions designed to minimize complexity and embrace AI-forward development.

Jac targets Python bytecode, so all Python libraries work with Jac.
